# vuetify-tauri-template

This is a template that combines the web development tools of Vue.js and Vuetify with the Tauri framework. This template allows Vue.js fans to build desktop applications with their pre-existing skillset. The Tauri framework builds production ready desktop applications that are light and fast. This efficiency is made possible by the use of the Rust programming language as the application's backend. 
Enjoy and use responsibly!
